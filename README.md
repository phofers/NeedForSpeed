This is a mod (bepinex plugin) for Ages of Conflict that adds new game speeds. 

This adds: 
 - 0.1x
 - 0.2x
 - 0.8x
 - 10x
 - 20x
 - all speeds that are multiples of 5 up to 100 (15x, 20x, 25x, etc)
<br>
Speeds over 100x are disabled by default, but you can enable them by editing the config file found at Bepinex/config/NeedForSpeed.cfg in your game folder:
<br>

 - 150x
 - 200x
 - 300x
 - 250x
 - 500x
 - 1000x
 - 2000x

The game gets buggy when you start to go above 100x speed so that's why I've done this. <br>
It also becomes quite laggy, even on higher end PCs!<br>
Going on very high speeds tend to make you simulate for a long time, and that tends to make your history log file quite large, so it may take some time for it to open when you hit the button or crash your game.
Here be dragons!<br>

You will need bepinex for this. Follow the tutorial to install:
